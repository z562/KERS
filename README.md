    to train subgoal generation model
* ```run_predict_subgoal.py```:
    to predict subgoal
* ```train_knowledge_generation.py```:
    to train knowledge generation model
* ```run_predicate_knowledge.py```:
    to predict knowledge
* ```run_KERS.py```:
    to train KERS model
* ```run_generation_KERS```.py:
    to generate response
